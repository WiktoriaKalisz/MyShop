## UX Principles Applied

The design of MyShop incorporates few key UX principles to create an intuitive and user-friendly experience:

- **Aesthetic-Usability Effect**  
Clean and visually appealing design with large product imagery makes the shop feel modern and easy to use, increasing perceived usability.

- **Chunking**  
Products are displayed in consistent cards with grouped details (image, title, price), enabling users to easily scan content.

- **Jakob’s Law**  
Navigation and product pages follow familiar e-commerce patterns (menu at the top, product grid, filters, add-to-bag button), reducing the learning curve for users.

- **Von Restorff Effect**  
Discounted prices are highlighted in red, standing out from other text and drawing attention to promotions.
